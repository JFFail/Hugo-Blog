    <p>A coworker and I ran into something of an oddity yesterday that started the snowball rolling on some research digging into the guts of how PowerShell operates as a langauge. Let me say up front that, with as much as Microsoft is working to make PowerShell the de facto scripting language on Windows, it&rsquo;s both surprising and frustrating how little is published in the way of official documentation. While there&rsquo;s a lot of good stuff people are writing it&rsquo;s always in blogs of Stack Overflow discussions. Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t, at least at the time of this writing, have any official documentation like what I&rsquo;d reference for <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/">Ruby</a> or <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlapi.html">Perl</a>.</p>

<p>The behavior which kicked off our confusion was how PowerShell handles passing parameters to functions. Take this very simple example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test
{
    param($Value)
    $Value *= 2
}

$number = 3
Test -Value $number
$number
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this is just 3. The reason is that when I pass <strong>$number</strong> to the <strong>Test</strong> function, it&rsquo;s a <em>copy</em> of the value. Thus <strong>$number</strong> never changes. The behavior is different, however, when I pass an object. Take this example:</p>

<pre><code>function Test
{
    param($Value)
    $Value.Add(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
}

$something = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
Test -Value $something
$something
</code></pre>

<p>The value printed to the screen here is &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;. The difference is that <strong>$something</strong> is being modified eventhough it&rsquo;s being passed to the function. That clearly <em>doesn&rsquo;t</em> happen when passing a non-object. What gives?</p>

<p>After quite a bit of digging, I failed miserably at finding anything of substance about this topic as it relates to PowerShell. That being said, I was able to find some very <em>good</em> information on the topic as it relates to C#, the language used to create PowerShell. In particular this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23041297/why-are-objects-automatically-passed-by-reference">Stack Overflow</a> thread and this <a href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/parameters.html">article</a> really helped to clear things up for me.</p>

<p>If you want the super detailed explanation, read the content at those links. If you want the short version, however, read on. In C# there are two main sorts of variables: value types and reference types. For value type variables, the value of the variable is the data itself. In my first example, <strong>$number</strong> is a value type, and that means the value of it is 3. Reference types are different. For anything which is a reference type, the value of the variable is a <em>reference</em> to the data. So in my second example, <strong>$something</strong> has a value which is simply a reference to where the ArrayList lives. That&rsquo;s why passing <strong>$something</strong> to a function changes what <strong>$something</strong> actually contains; it&rsquo;s a reference that is being passed and the original data is being changed!</p>

<p>To simplify this a bit I can take functions out of the equation entirely. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>$first = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList
$second = $first
$second.Add(&quot;Hello!&quot;)
$first
</code></pre>

<p>The output of this is &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;. When I set <strong>$second</strong> equal to <strong>$first</strong>, I&rsquo;m setting <strong>$second</strong> equal to the reference to where the data of <strong>$first</strong> lives. Since <strong>$first</strong> and <strong>$second</strong> both reference the <em>same thing</em>, adding new data to <strong>$second</strong> means that <strong>$first</strong> is now different as well!</p>

<p>After realizing that this is how C# functions, it makes <em>much</em> more sense why PowerShell behaves the way it does. As a further test, I wanted to see if I could emulate the same behavior in PowerShell by using the <code>ref</code> keyword that C# leverages to pass primitives as references. Sure enough, that&rsquo;s possible as well:</p>

<pre><code>function Test
{
    param([ref]$Value)
    $Value.Value *= 2
}

$number = 3
Test -Value ([ref]$number)
$number
</code></pre>

<p>Executing this gives me a value of 6. By using the <code>ref</code> keyword, I&rsquo;m able to pass a reference to the function just like I would in C#. Thus the actual data stored by what <strong>$number</strong> references is now changed. Note that when performing the operation inside of my function, however, I can&rsquo;t just do that against <strong>$Value</strong>. The reason for this is that <strong>$Value</strong> is <em>only a reference</em>. If I want to do something against its data, I need to act on it&rsquo;s <strong>Value</strong> property.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone else stumbles across this post and is saved from having to spend a bit of time hunting for an explanation if they notice the same behavior in PowerShell that we did.</p>

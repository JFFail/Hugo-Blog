    <p>It&rsquo;s far from impressive, but recently I&rsquo;ve been using some of my free Azure hosting via Dreamspark for this blog. The <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/app-service/">free tier</a> isn&rsquo;t exactly impressive, but it&rsquo;s not too bad for just messing around with Azure a bit and learning; I&rsquo;m pretty sure learning is really what the free tier is intended for regardless. Since I&rsquo;ve had plenty of time to get my hands on a lot of the IaaS and SaaS offerings in Azure, I figured I needed to step things up in the PaaS department.</p>

<p>Rather than just hosting my own HTML files like I do <a href="http://awk.ninja">on GitHub</a>, though, I wanted to see about using something like <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> or <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to parse together a static HTML blog that could be hosted out of Azure. I&rsquo;m already familiar with both frameworks <a href="http://failtime.freeshell.org">from SDF</a>, and I&rsquo;m a <em>huge</em> fan. Being able to so easily create static HTML blogs is <strong>incredible</strong>, and I can&rsquo;t give enough credit to the teams behind these projects. Plus, they seemed like a perfect fit considering that Azure Web Apps allow you to do <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-publish-source-control/">continuous deployment via Git</a>. So in my case I can link my Azure Web App to a GitHub repository. Then whenever I push a change to that repo, it&rsquo;ll automatically load in Azure. Cool!</p>

<p>The hiccup I ran into is that, by default, when you link an Azure Web App to a Git repository Azure wants to serve up the <em>root</em> of that repository. In my case that was problematic because the root of it was the root of <a href="https://github.com/JFFail/Hugo-Blog">my Hugo directory</a>; the HTML files I wanted to be hosted were in the <code>/public</code> directory. After a little bit of searching, I learned that <a href="https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu">Kudu</a> is the answer to this. Kudu is the engine behind Git deployments in Azure. You can create a file in the root of your repository called <code>.deployment</code> and use that to tell Kudu where to look for the files to host. It seems to use TOML for the markup, which is great since that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been using for Hugo as well. The only things I added to my deployment file were:</p>

<pre><code>[config]
project = public
</code></pre>

<p>This lets Kudu know that when it goes to host the content in my repository it should be looking in the <code>public</code> folder rather than in the root. I also temporarily flipped which repository my Azure Web App was looking at to test it out with <a href="https://github.com/JFFail/Blog">this Jekyll repo</a>. Things also worked perfectly with Jekyll; I just had to modify my deployment file to take into account the default folder where Jekyll wants to publish HTML:</p>

<pre><code>[config]
project = _site
</code></pre>

<p>I have no doubt there are a <em>ton</em> of other things you can do with Kudu to further customize Git deployments in Azure. I was just geeked, though, to be able to do precisely what I wanted with so little effort.</p>
